# Hello there!
Myself Souradeep Kar, junior at IIT Guwahati pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering.  
I have tried my hands on web development and android development as well, and here you will find all the projects I have done till this point and also I have tried my best to document properly so that almost anyone can go through the readme file and get a basic idea of what is being done. And I am also very interested in Frontend development as well and still learning it to my best. And also I am int the process of developing my developer portfolio website too. I am also interested in data science and ML related projects and I am still discovering that domain. Other domains of my interest include UI/UX design and video editing.
